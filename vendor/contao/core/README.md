This repository contains the source code of Contao 3.

Contao 3.5 is currently in the "security fixes only" phase of its [long term
support cycle][1] and **does not receive bug fixes anymore** unless they fix a
security vulnerability. It will reach its end of life in May 2019.

The source code of Contao 4 is maintained in several bundles that you can find
in the [Contao organization][2] on GitHub. Please use the issue tracker of the
respective bundle to report issues in Contao.
